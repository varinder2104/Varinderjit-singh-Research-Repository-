This folder consists of all the tasks which are given by our lecturer in the class. These codes consist of the principles of the python programming language that are done in the class. These are all about applying and understanding the points which are covered in that lecture, which helps to memorise the concepts for future and to build confidence in hands-on-approach.

###[Exercise Week 6](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/tree/main/software%20development/Exercises/Exercise_week6.py) 

In this folder, there are 2 codes i.e. [Library](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/blob/main/software%20development/Exercises/Exercise_week6.py/Library_system.py) and [Pet](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/blob/main/software%20development/Exercises/Exercise_week6.py/Pet.py).
Library: When you run this code, it will work as library system as it will help the user to know about available books, add new patron, register a new book, for returning and borrowing a book. This all will be showed in like a small menu. And this code consists of the three classes (Book), (Patron), (Library) and at a calling function (main) which helps to control the system that, how it will run.
Pet: In this code, pet’s information will be given like the species, name, age and birthday of the animal. It consist of one class (Pet) and for calling (main).


###[Band members](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/blob/main/software%20development/Exercises/Exercise_band_members.py)

In this code, a poster for the band is made consist of band name, members name, concert date and place with the help of three def functions.

###[Generate emails](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/blob/main/software%20development/Exercises/Exercise_generate_email.py):

This code is about to create an email about the concert information and to send it to the band members. And we learn about lists here.

###[Generate tickets](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/blob/main/software%20development/Exercises/Exercise_generate_tickets.py):

When you run this code, a ticket will be created including the name, category, seat number and ticket price. Here, we learn about the random to generate random seat numbers.

###[Exercise 1](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/blob/main/software%20development/Exercises/exercise1.py):

In this code, a grocery store calculation will take place with some discount code. And will be done by format string.

###[Exercise 2](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/blob/main/software%20development/Exercises/exercise2.py):

Here, simple calculations are done with the help of python operations.


##[Self-made codes](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/tree/main/software%20development/Self-made%20Codes)

In this folder, the self-coded codes (assignments) are included. In this various topics of the course are covered and gathered at one place to implement every concept learnt through lectures and exercises. 

###[Requisition ticket system](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/tree/main/software%20development/Self-made%20Codes/requisition_ticket_system):

This code consists of the 4 tasks which plays different roles in making of overall requisition system. In task 1 the staff information is collected, also a unique requisition id is generated and in task 2 total takes place like how many items are purchased are their total price. In task 3, the requisitions are approved under some conditions with the reference id and at last in task 4 all the tasks are imported and calling takes place. And it is done by functions.

###[Requisition system 2](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/blob/main/software%20development/Self-made%20Codes/requisition_ticket_system2/RequisitionSystems.py):

In this code, the improved version of requisition code is made in a single code, going through collecting the staff information and generating unique requisition id and collecting item names and prices after that approved on conditions and issuing the reference id. And the manager will respond to the pending requests here manually and show the changed status of the requisitions. At last statistics are shown. It is made by one class RequisitionSystem.

##[Lectures](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/tree/main/software%20development/Self-made%20Codes)

All the remaining folders are in class examples of the codes given by the lecturer which consists of every topic like using variables, performing calculations, using the functions, classes and getting to know about other vast topics of python.

###[Week 1-4](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/tree/main/software%20development/week%201-4):

This folder includes the codes that are done in class while learning the basic concepts in week 1 to 4 of our course. Which consists of codes like (Assessment 2, bingo, arithmetic operators, collect user data, movie booking, python recap, test and the week1) in these we learn the types of variables, exponential, arithmetic operators, modulus, importing inbuilt functions like math, upper & lower case and concatenation.

###[Week 5](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/tree/main/software%20development/week%205):

This folder consists of codes covered in week 5 of course and the codes are like (book, car, lecture1, methods and cat). In this we learn about the dictionary, classes, functions and the ANSI colour codes to make the output colourful. And importing sound with import and controlling its pitch and volume.

###[Week 6](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/tree/main/software%20development/Week%206):

This folder consists the topics covered on week 6 and the codes are (cat, main and product). On week 6, we learn about the parent and child classes, global variables, the annotations, getter and setter method and super variable to inherit the values in parent class. And the code (cat) is called in the code (main).

###[Week 7](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/blob/main/software%20development/week%207/Members.py):

In the week 7, we combined all the concepts in one code to recap it and add some new concepts also like adding value to list with append and applying the multiple loops. It is a membership system, when we run it, it will show a menu and help us to navigate through different options and functions of the code.

###[Concert booking](https://github.com/varinder2104/Varinderjit-singh-Research-Repository-/tree/main/software%20development/concert%20booking):

This code includes the booking system distributed in different tasks from 1-3 and calling the whole program in task 4 with the help of the functions. And consists of loops, different variables, id generator, making of reference number by combining two variables and try & except function also. 

##Principles

###Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):

Every function in my code is created to carry out just that task. For instance, the function for checking user approval doesn’t address how information is printed or shown. Likewise, display-specific logic is kept apart from any calculation or approval actions. Every kind of function serves just one specific purpose.

###Open/Closed Principle:

The code has been built so that new features can be easily added without affecting the existing parts. It’s possible to add fresh rules or new functions without messing with the current ones. As a result, the system can be adapted and expanded when required.

###KISS – Keep It Simple, Stupid:

My coding style was always simple and direct as I worked on the project. People will find it easy to use all the app functions. Every conditional check (such as one for an amount that falls under a threshold) uses a basic if statement so that we prevent making things complicated.

###Composition instead of using Inheritance:

Though I did not inherit from classes, I split my code into similar parts that were easy to reuse. Rather than putting every bit of logic into one place, I separated them into different functions that can be used anywhere.

###The idea of Separation of Concerns:

The code is divided into small chunks and every script does one specific function. No matter if I am processing approval, handling user input, displaying facts or doing calculations—every part remains separate. In turn, handling maintenance is simple because modifying one thing does not impact others.

###DRY – Don’t Repeat Yourself:

Extra logic was taken out so the codebase would be clean and efficient. Just one function handles the printing of advising details. Every modification required in print logic is made in the same location, so the task does not need to be repeated.

###YAGNI – You Aren’t Gonna Need It:

I included only the essential features when starting the project. Every line of code either serves a purpose or is unnecessary. The program’s structure is built to help now and avoids making designs too complex.

###Don’t try to make your code faster before you have to:

My first goal was making the code function properly and after that, I worked on making it faster. Once we confirmed everything worked as expected, I concentrated on making the software’s code more organized.

###After working on refactoring, I focus on adopting Clean Code:

I went over the project again after finishing the original code to see what could be made better. I got rid of useless code lines, named things in the program that made the most sense and organized the code so that it is easier to understand and care for.
