1	Exercises

This folder consists of all the tasks which are given by our lecturer in the class. These codes consist of the principles of the python programming language that are done in the class. These are all about applying and understanding the points which are covered in that lecture, which helps to memorise the concepts for future and to build confidence in hands-on-approach.

1.1.1	        Exercise Week 6 

In this folder, there are 2 codes i.e. Library and Pet.
Library: When you run this code, it will work as library system as it will help the user to know about available books, add new patron, register a new book, for returning and borrowing a book. This all will be showed in like a small menu. And this code consists of the three classes (Book), (Patron), (Library) and at a calling function (main) which helps to control the system that, how it will run.
Pet: In this code, petâ€™s information will be given like the species, name, age and birthday of the animal. It consist of one class (Pet) and for calling (main).


1.1.2	     Band members

In this code, a poster for the band is made consist of band name, members name, concert date and place with the help of three def functions.

1.1.3	    Generate emails:

This code is about to create an email about the concert information and to send it to the band members. And we learn about lists here.

1.1.4	     Generate tickets:

When you run this code, a ticket will be created including the name, category, seat number and ticket price. Here, we learn about the random to generate random seat numbers.

1.1.5	      Exercise 1:

In this code, a grocery store calculation will take place with some discount code. And will be done by format string.
1.1.6	      Exercise 2:

Here, simple calculations are done with the help of python operations.


2	Self-made codes

In this folder, the self-coded codes (assignments) are included. In this various topics of the course are covered and gathered at one place to implement every concept learnt through lectures and exercises. 

2.1.1	   Requisition ticket system:

This code consists of the 4 tasks which plays different roles in making of overall requisition system. In task 1 the staff information is collected, also a unique requisition id is generated and in task 2 total takes place like how many items are purchased are their total price. In task 3, the requisitions are approved under some conditions with the reference id and at last in task 4 all the tasks are imported and calling takes place. And it is done by functions.

2.1.2	    Requisition system 2:

In this code, the improved version of requisition code is made in a single code, going through collecting the staff information and generating unique requisition id and collecting item names and prices after that approved on conditions and issuing the reference id. And the manager will respond to the pending requests here manually and show the changed status of the requisitions. At last statistics are shown. It is made by one class RequisitionSystem.

3	Lectures

All the remaining folders are in class examples of the codes given by the lecturer which consists of every topic like using variables, performing calculations, using the functions, classes and getting to know about other vast topics of python.

3.1.1	   Week 1-4:

This folder includes the codes that are done in class while learning the basic concepts in week 1 to 4 of our course. Which consists of codes like (Assessment 2, bingo, arithmetic operators, collect user data, movie booking, python recap, test and the week1) in these we learn the types of variables, exponential, arithmetic operators, modulus, importing inbuilt functions like math, upper & lower case and concatenation.

3.1.2	    Week 5:

This folder consists of codes covered in week 5 of course and the codes are like (book, car, lecture1, methods and cat). In this we learn about the dictionary, classes, functions and the ANSI colour codes to make the output colourful. And importing sound with import and controlling its pitch and volume.

3.1.3	    Week 6:

This folder consists the topics covered on week 6 and the codes are (cat, main and product). On week 6, we learn about the parent and child classes, global variables, the annotations, getter and setter method and super variable to inherit the values in parent class. And the code (cat) is called in the code (main).

3.1.4	     Week 7:

In the week 7, we combined all the concepts in one code to recap it and add some new concepts also like adding value to list with append and applying the multiple loops. It is a membership system, when we run it, it will show a menu and help us to navigate through different options and functions of the code.

3.1.5	      Concert booking:

This code includes the booking system distributed in different tasks from 1-3 and calling the whole program in task 4 with the help of the functions. And consists of loops, different variables, id generator, making of reference number by combining two variables and try & except function also.
